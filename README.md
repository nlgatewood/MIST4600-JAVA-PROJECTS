**MurderMansion** - Final Group Project
---------------------------------------
Text-based RPG Game.  Story is loosely built off of of the board game 'Clue'.  You are an investigator trying to solve a murder at the Darling Manor.  You must visit rooms, collect items, and find characters.  You must decide who the murder is, what the murder weapon is, and where the murder took place.  Once you think you've decided on those three things you can go back to your partner and guess.
